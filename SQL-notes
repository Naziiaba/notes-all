-------------      GROUP BY      ------------------------

--  1) In	the	Person.Person	table,	how	many	people	are	associated	with	each	PersonType?
SELECT PersonType,
		COUNT(*) AS PersonCount 
FROM Person.Person
GROUP BY PersonType

---   2) Using	only	one	query,	find	out	how	many	products	in	Production.Product	are	the	
--- color	�red�	and	how	many	are	�black�.
SELECT Color,
		COUNT(*) AS ProductCount FROM Production.Product
WHERE Color IN ('red', 'black')
Group By color


--3) Using	Sales.SalesOrderHeader,	how	many	sales	occurred	in	each	territory	between	
--July	1,	2005	and	December	31,	2006?		Order	the	results	by	the	sale	count	in	
--descending	order.
SELECT TerritoryID, 
	COUNT(*) AS SalesCount 
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '07/01/2005' AND '12/31/2006' 
GROUP BY TerritoryID


--4) Expanding	on	the	previous	example,	group	the	results	not	by	the	TerritoryID	but	by	
--the	name	of	the	territory	(found	in	the	Sales.SalesTerritory	table).
SELECT ST.Name AS [Territory Name], 
	COUNT(*) AS SalesCount

LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.SalesTerritory ST
ON ST.TerritoryID = SOH.TerritoryID
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '07/01/2005' AND '12/31/2006' 
GROUP BY ST.Name
