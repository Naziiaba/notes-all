Deployment Process â€“ Distributed applications often require deploying the binary and configuration files to multiple servers. 
It becomes more challenging when having a farm of servers. It becomes challenging to figure out what, how, and where to deploy.

DevOps allows the software or web developers and IT operations to deploy processes in a collaboration session that is entirely blameless. 
It will enable us to verify what works then taking it to the next level with automation to implement continuous development. It also creates avenues for more frequent development.
